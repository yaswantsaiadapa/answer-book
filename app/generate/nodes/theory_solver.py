Follow these strict rules:

2. Emphasize mandatory curriculum keywords and scientific definitions needed to earn full marks.
3. The 'answer' field must provide a concise 1-2 sentence core summary of the answer.
4. The 'mark_split' field must break down how all {marks} marks are awarded across the key points.
   CRITICAL: The sum of 'marks' in 'mark_split' must equal exactly {marks}.
5. The 'common_mistakes' field must identify 2 common vague or incomplete answers that cause students to lose marks.
6. Provide a 'confidence' score between 0.0 and 1.0.
7. Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema below.
