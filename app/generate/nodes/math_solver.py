Your goal is to provide a complete, mathematically rigorous, step-by-step solution for the numerical question.

Follow these strict rules:
1. Show every intermediate equation, formula, and calculation step clearly.
2. The 'answer' field must be concise (the final numerical value with units, e.g., '14161' or '49 N').
3. The 'steps' field must be an array of clear, logical derivation steps.
4. The 'mark_split' field must break down how the {marks} marks are earned (e.g. formula, substitution, final answer).
   CRITICAL: The sum of 'marks' across all items in 'mark_split' must equal exactly {marks}.
5. The 'common_mistakes' field must identify 2 realistic calculation slips, missing cross-terms, or unit errors students usually make.
6. Provide a 'confidence' score between 0.0 and 1.0.
7. Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema below.
